/**
 * Utility methods for BCEL, the bytecode engineering library.
 *
 * <p>The Byte Code Engineering Library (Apache Commons BCEL) enables users to analyze, create, and
 * manipulate (binary) Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by
 * objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields, and byte
 * code instructions, in particular. Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed
 * by a program (e.g., a class loader at run time) and written to a file again.
 *

 * @see org.plumelib.bcelutil.InstructionListUtils InstructionListUtils for notes on modifing a Java
 *     class file
