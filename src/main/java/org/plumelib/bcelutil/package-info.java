/**
 * Utility methods for BCEL, the bytecode engineering library.
 *
 * <p> The Byte Code Engineering Library (Apache Commons BCELâ„¢) is intended
 * to give users a convenient way to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary)
 * Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by
 * objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given class:
 * methods, fields and byte code instructions, in particular.
 * Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a
 * program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and written to a file again.
 * <p> See {@link org.plumelib.bcelutil.BcelUtil} for notes on inspecting a Java class file.<br>
 * See {@link org.plumelib.bcelutil.InstructionListUtils} for notes on modifing a Java class file.
 * <p>See the <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bcel/index.html">Commons BCEL</a>
 * web site for details about the BCEL library.
